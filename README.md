# synchro-to-csv
A tool used to convert Synchro 10 txt result files to csv files for easier analysis. Synchro 10 only allows users to save analysis results in text files, which is hard to transcribe when summarizing vehicle delay and LOS by approach or intersection. This tool analyzes the Synchro text files, and saves vehicle delay and LOS result by approach for each intersection, allowing users to quickly translate HCM 2010 and HCM 2000 results into presentable formats.
